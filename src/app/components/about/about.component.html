    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I'm a full-stack software engineer with 8+ years of experience delivering scalable enterprise solutions.
      I've architected modular ERP systems for schools and retail, built sync services for biometric attendance,
      and led integrations for vending automation. I specialize in .NET Core, Node.js, Angular, and cloud-ready
      deployments using Docker and CI/CD.
